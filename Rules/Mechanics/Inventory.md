Every character has an inventory, and thus, has the space to carry things with them.
There are three mechanics to this:
- Weight
- Volume

Next to that, common pouches still exists.

## Weight
Every item has it's own weight, and each character a carrying capacity.

Carrying capacity is calculated using the following formula:
```40 + strength * 4```

## Volume
The volume which a character can carry is based on the characters equipment.
A backpack, for example; can give the user more volume, but not more carrying capacity.
