- Keep it based in reality. No magic bs and stuff.
- Church of Dog is an a generally known thing in the public, the shady shit the [[Black Dogs]] is not. Don't go making a civilian character with knowledge about that.
- Realistic carry capacity. Most of the characters (with a few exceptions) are not extremely unnaturally strong and cannot go carrying a dozen of machine guns.
- Initial skills cannot be incredibly high (Recruits cannot be gods at snipping). The initial skill in [[Black Dogs]] is already quite high however (elite of the elite), so don't go underpowering either.
- [[PROJECT-INFUSION]] is a limited thing and may not be used unless explicitly specified.
- You can't specialize in multiple fields at the same time. You can't be a god at CQB and sniping at the same time. You can however, still have skills in fields not your specialization.
- Make your backstory believable, no "born in distant galaxy"
- Keep it unique, try not copying or having a too similar backstory as someone else (exceptions being, for example: Childhood friend, related, etc)

# Character deaths:
A character can only die if it is planned out and decided by the owner of said character that the character should die. Else, the character is just critically injured.

## Passive checks:
TODO: But basically skills (for a DND style campaign) that allow the user to, for example: Detect traps/enemies, convince NPC's in talks without trying, capability of finding clues without rolling, etc.
