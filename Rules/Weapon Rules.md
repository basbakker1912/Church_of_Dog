# Firearms:
Firearms can have a multitude of attachments to allow the user to better personalize their gear. For example, a shorter barrel would give a bonus to agility indoors, but would negatively affect long range accuracy.

Damage of weaponry is primarily based on calibre of the weapon, and not the weapon type. 
(A pistol and smg can do the same amount of damage if they have the same calibre)

A firearms will always kill in a single hit if a 19 or higher is thrown, unless the enemy has some sort of ballistic helmet.

# Melee:
Varies per weapon, rules would be made on a weapon to weapon basis.
