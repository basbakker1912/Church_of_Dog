Every piece of armor has two values:
- Defence
- Hp

Defence in the maximum penetration value armor protect against.
Hp is the amount of HP the armor has. When the armor stops a bullet, the damage would go onto the armor, instead of the character.

If the bullet penetrates through the defence, the armor takes 20% of the damage and the character takes 80% of it.
