Combat follow the DND rules.

Every enemy has a DC and skills around this DC.

Skills for an enemy are rolled as followed:
> Define the DC and the differentiation range.
> Roll for each skill and map it to the range.
> Add or remove the rolled value from the DC.

Whether a gunshot hits an enemy is based on the following rule:
> When shot at an enemy, the enemy makes two rolls.
> One: A perception check to see if the enemy sees the shooter
> Two: A dodge check to see if the bullet is dodged
> 
> The shot is seen if the perception check is higher than the slight of hand roll of the player aiming the gun.
> 
> The shot is dodged if the dexterity roll of the enemy is higher than the accuracy of the player.
