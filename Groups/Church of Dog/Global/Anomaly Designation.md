The [[Anomaly Designation]] was originally though of an implemented by the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]], taken over by [[Church of Dog]] seeing it's simplicity and their willingness to keep compatibility with enemy designation for ease of identifying documents.

The following designations exist:

### GA: General Anomaly
GA is designated towards anomalies that have the ability to replicate themselves, and often specify a species of anomalies, and not the anomaly themselves.

## DA: Dedicated Anomaly
DA is designated towards anomalies that have only one of them in existence,

## DSA: Dedicated Spatial Anomaly
DSA is designated towards anomalies that are spatially grounded, or create a space of their own. These anomalies often create a new dimension, or bend the space in their vicinity. All of them have in common, however, that they do not move, and are statically attached to where they are positioned.

## HVA: High Value Anomaly
HVA is designated towards anomalies that the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] has marked as high valuing.
