# Backstory
--- 
The [[Church of Dog]] was created after [[Bad God]] decided to ban [[Dogs]] to the [[Country of YES]], and attempts to spread the love of [[Dogs]] back all over humanity, commonly done with bribery using Ice Cream, a rare delicacy only created using sacred forgotten rituals owned by the [[Church of Dog]].

It's more of an Ideology than a Religion, because god ([[Good God]]) is just vibing. Praying is not required and done rarely, and the only goal of those that follow the [[Church of Dog]] is to spread the love of [[Dogs]].
