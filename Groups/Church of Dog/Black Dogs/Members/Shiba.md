# Backstory\
The white light filling my blurry eyes is blinding, voices which I cannot understand fill my ears. The sound slowly melts together to form words, and then sentences.

"Blo...-p...sure stabi....ng."

"Ene... levels corre...."

"He awake?" The last voice calls, somehow, familiar?

"Yes Sir, subject codename: 'Shiba' has successfully awoken."

'Shiba?' He liked that name.

The man, not older than his thirties.




NOTES:
- Is the first of the [[Demi-Dogs]]
- Due to the [[Demi-Dogs]] extra strength, he caries a fridge as a melee weapon.
  This fridge can collapse into the size of a sword and be strapped onto his back.
  Powered by a black hole to collapse the inside contents without damaging them.
- Food nerd, can smell poison on whatever the food is.
- Due to being the first result of [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], and the experiment going differently than expected. His Soul is in direct connection to the [[Good God]], who can talk to him, listen to his ears and see through his eyes. Next to this, [[Shiba]] can use the [[Good God]]'s remaining power for his own doings.
- Is the only [[Demi-Dogs]] that knows the recipe to ice cream, being directly told by the [[Good God]].
