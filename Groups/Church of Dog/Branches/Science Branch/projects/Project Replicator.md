[[Project Replicator]] was originally split off of [[Project Infusion]] when the original body synthesizer was not effective enough to their needs.

Instead of dismantling the body synthesizer, they reused it in [[Project Replicator]] to allow for a way to make "immortal" soldiers. Giving them a new body upon death with all memories intact, allowing for less training.

The prototype was functional, but the project was abandoned because the system did not allow for uploading new minds, and was too costly for it's purpose, seeing that it required a new replicator to be build for every soldier. Next to that, soldiers casualties were lower than expected, and thus, the Replicator was not needed.

The single prototype however, and the synthetic mind within, was kept around and is currently position within the [[Black Dogs]] as the member [[Karlis]].
