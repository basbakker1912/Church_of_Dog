# Backstory.
Kira was adopted by [[Fate]] in 2 ACY, after her hometown got burned to the ground during [[The Seraphos Extermination]], her parents killed when she was just ten. She suffered heavy burning injuries from the fire, which was the main reason [[Fate]] took her in, not being able to let the ability to do something about her condition go over their heart.

She received an artificial skin transplant in 3 ACY.

During the bring your child to work day in 6 ACY, a raid was performed by the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] upon the lab, where she was kidnapped.

 She was forced to become a test subject to whatever the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] could come up with. She was used to develop an [[Amnestics]], along a whole other set of kidnapped [[Church of Dog]] personnel and other civilians. She was also used for a whole other set of experiments, like the attempted counter by the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] against the [[Project Infusion]], which has remained uncompleted till this day.

These scientific experiments included:
- Wiping her memory repeatedly
- Injecting false memories
- Modifying her biological structure
- Modifying her DNA
- Modifying her personality and mind

She was found and rescued in 13 ACY during [[Operation Shutdown]], and was put into a high-care private facility by [[Fate]], who she didn't remember, and her artificial memories even told her they were dangerous. These memories were regained after [[Fate]] treated her for a year. Where she slowly started to question her own memories seeing how [[Fate]] cared for her relative to her memories. Which allowed the medical treatment to work in the first place. Some things (devil-like horns) were kept, seeing that they did not pose a health risk and were even denoted to be liked by Kira herself.

Her parent became quite distant for a year after that, being gone a lot and seemingly not having time for her. [[Fate]] was focussing on his own illness though, that would soon kill him without a solution. This was understandable for [[Kira]], but was still a hard thing to accept.

In this time, she continued her schoolwork, and although she had high academic scores, she fell behind due to the social aspect, and being a lot older than her peers.

When she turned twenty-three in 15 ACY, [[Fate]] was there with an artificial arm and most of his abnormities gone (among other changes to Fate's physical appearance.) 

[[Fate]] gave her a tour of [[LAB-03]], where she was allowed to stay and help study under Fate's supervision. She helped with quite a few discoveries. Although her knowledge is severely limited, her work in the field instead of behind a desk helped her learn a lot and soon she came to be [[Fate]] their assistant and right hand.

In 19 ACY, she requested a small team to start her own project, which was gladly granted after [[Fate]] not so subtilty convinced the rest of the [[Science Council]]. She was given access to a plenty of resources and made the prototype [[Cyara]] system in early 21 ACY.
