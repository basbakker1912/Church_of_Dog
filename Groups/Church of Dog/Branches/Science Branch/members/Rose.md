## Characteristics:
"No one dies unless i fucking let him die" is her motto while she is on the floor. Giving 110% every shift no mater how long or hard it is. Absolute gamer in her free time and a heavy drinker. She got realistic approach to every situation she will find herself in.

## Backstory:

She is also 'designated' [[Black Dogs]] medic when they come back to base, she used to be assigned to them often due to her skills but now all medical personnel know to take over whatever she was doing the moment they hear a call in any way connected to [[Black Dogs]]

...

All med staff and patients are happy with her performance and enjoy her pleasant personality, unless you ask [[Shiba]], due to theirs never ending 'conflict' they will never say anything positive about each other, Rose claims it all started when he run into her and refuse to say sorry till this day. Yet Rose do every thing do be the one taking care of [[Shiba]]s wounds if needed.

(My notes i did not include above but wil
A medic in CoD specializing in helping BlackDogs units is one of the few who can talk to them to effectively determine what is wrong despite the fact that many of them will not admit they need help due to their egos. The nickname RosÄ™ refers to her above average beauty and the fact that she can take care of herself)
