## Characteristics:
Fate is mostly quiet individual. Preferring to spend time diving into their research over communicating, although given the chance, will ramble for hours over his current and past research projects.

Non-Binary/Genderflux

Fate's age is unimportant, seeing that their modifiable genomes allow for reversing and accelerating their age to any they wish. 

Fate's genetic condition also affects their psyche, although they used to be quite the caring individual, the changes in their genes allow them to switch personality on a whim. Fate uses this to their advantage when it comes to getting their way from time to time, but is careful with that.

Fate modifies their personality within their genes to act more to their preferred personality, but internally, they are a caring individual, and in the midst of things, they can't shake that.

They have the following three they use more consistently, the latter most often:
- An athletic, adult male, 190 cm in height. Has blond hair and grey eyes.
  The personality in this form is focussed and targeted, but has some sense of the wishes of others (basically Fate before the arm)
- An adult female 32 year old, 174 cm in height. Has white hair and yellow eyes with a slit pupil (snake-ish). 
  Although still caring, they become more cold and apathetic in this shape.
- A ambiguous figure, standing 180 cm's tall. They have long, white hair. Yellow eyes and a very light coloured skin. 

Almost always wears a white lab coat.
## Backstory:
Born twenty-two years before the takeover of [[Malphoros]], and has been fascinated by the biological beings that inhabit the world. Spending most of his time catching small reptiles and amphibious animals and keeping them in his room.

What interested Fate more, however, was the minds of those around them. The working of their consciousness and the manipulation of their thoughts was fascinating to them. Fate got caught by his mother dissecting a frog at the age of fourteen while it was still alive.

Fate continued experimenting with biological mutations and adaptations for a while after. Experiments often ending in failures, using the machinery they could afford by selling the AI's he trained on his computer while trying to reconstruct a mind digitally. He made a pretty penny selling things he considered as failures.

Unable to finish their final years in biochemistry at their university, seeing as the world got taken by storm by [[Malphoros]] killing [[Seraphos]]. This takeover, however, gave up a multitude of new chances. As the [[Anomalies]] made by [[Malphoros]] gave Fate a formidable job in the [[Country of YES]] two years later, who seemed to hire whomever wished to help them with their research.

Fate quickly became accustomed, and was even the first to be able to artificially synthesise simple anomalies leading a small team of his two closest friends, one of them being [[164xx]], who grew interest in his project, giving him the funding he needed to accomplish most goals, the other being [[Ariah Marlyn Grey]], who's research into the extraction of DNA from anomalies made it possible to synthesize them in the first place, seeing that their cellular structure is quite different to the ones found in most animals.

They adopted one of children ([[Kira]]) fleeing from the mainland to [[Country of YES]] after [[The Seraphos Extermination]], taking her in as Fate's own.

This scientific breakthrough allowed them to quickly climb to the top of the ranks within [[Church of Dog]], creating bioweapons and biological entities supporting agriculture, construction and other branches. Although his contributions were somewhat smaller and he managed these projects more. This came as a consequence of [[Kira]] having heavily burned skin he prioritised making a substitute for, making the first fully biological synthetic skin replacement.

After becoming a member of the [[Science Council]] in 4 ACY, Fate focussed his attention to integrating modern technologies with the biological body. Creating the first fully functioning prosthetic body parts, like: legs, arms and even organs with a team of scientists. His motivations came after seeing how much [[Kira]]'s new skin helped her, not wanting others to save that fate.

During the [[Church of Dog Assasination]], Fate's daughter got kidnapped and he was almost killed. Among the fact that most of the [[Council of Dog]] was killed. He started his project in the soon to be finished [[LAB-03]] he requested to start [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], which was granted and was completed with success in 12 ACY.

After [[PROJECT-INFUSION]] was completed, and the definition of a perfect humanoid was made, Fate noticed the failure on their own flesh, and got hooked on improving the human genome. After being refused a test subject by the [[Council of Dog]], Fate took it upon himself and experimented upon their own genome. Causing Fate to get quite sick in 13 ACY.

In 13 ACY Fate was reunited with their daughter [[Kira]], who didn't remember them, and was even scared of them due to the injected memories. Fate then focussed on rehabilitating her and came quite far. Reversing most of the negative effects of the genetic manipulation and bringing back most of her memories. Reverse engineering of the [[Amnestics]] found in the raid showed that it made new pathways for memories or locked them away, they were never removed. 

Fate made their own bionic arm that extended into some of their internal organs. Acting as a form of life-support, while also allowing Fate to change their own genome on a whim. Giving them shape-shifting like abilities and stopping Fate's aging at the age of 37 (15 ACY).

During this time, a friend of him got into a deadly explosion and was saved by Fate using an experimental technique to turn normal people into [[Demi-Dogs]], which was successful with minor side-effects.

Currently actively working on [[THREAT]] with a small team of two other scientists in [[LAB-03]].

## Trivia:
- Bioengineered a creature for Halloween and let it loose in LAB-01. The entity was harmless, and died after five hours (due to not having a mouth to eat), but scared quite a few interns who thought it was an escaped entity.
