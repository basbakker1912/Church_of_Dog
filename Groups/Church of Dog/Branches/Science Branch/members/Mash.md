## Formal Data:
Name: Fate "\[CLASSIFIED]" Sebastian
Age: See Backstory
Physical Appearance: See Backstory

Member of: [[Church of Dog]]
Position: [[Science Council]] Member and Project Lead
Rank: #CDL5 
Researcher ID: 1912

Primary Project: [[THREAT]]
Secondary Projects: [[PROJECT-INFUSION]]

## Characteristics:
Fate is mostly quiet individual. Preferring to spend time diving into their research over communicating, although given the chance, will ramble for hours over his current and past research projects.

Non-Binary/Genderflux

Their age is permanently stuck at 34, due to the fact that their modifiable genomes also stop the aging process due to damaged genes and telomere depletion.

Fate's genetic condition also affects their psyche, although they used to be quite the caring individual, the changes in their genes allow them to switch personality on a whim. Fate uses this to their advantage when it comes to getting their way from time to time, but is careful with that.

They have the following three they use more consistently, the latter most often:
- An athletic, adult male, 190 cm in height. Has blond hair and grey eyes.
  The personality in this form is focussed and targeted, but has some sense of the wishes of others (basically Fate before the arm)
- An adult female. 174 cm in height. Has white hair and yellow eyes with a slit pupil (snake-ish). 
  Although still caring, they become more cold and apathetic in this shape.
- A ambiguous figure, standing 180 cm's tall. They have long, white hair. Yellow eyes and a very light coloured skin. 

Almost always wears a white lab coat.
## Backstory:
Born eighteen years before the takeover of [[Malphoros]], and has been fascinated by the biological beings that inhabit the world. Spending most of his time catching small reptiles and amphibious animals and keeping them in his room.

What interested Fate more, however, was the minds of those around them. The working of their consciousness and the manipulation of their thoughts was fascinating to them. Fate got caught by his mother dissecting a frog at the age of fourteen while it was still alive.

Fate continued experimenting with biological mutations and adaptations for a while after. Experiments often ending in failures, using the machinery they could afford by selling the AI's he trained on his computer while trying to reconstruct a mind digitally. He made a pretty penny selling things he considered as failures.

The world got taken by storm before Fate could start their Scholarship in Biochemistry, seeing as the world got taken by storm by [[Malphoros]] killing [[Seraphos]]. This takeover, however, gave up a multitude of new chances. As the [[Anomalies]] made by [[Malphoros]] gave Fate a formidable job in the [[Country of YES]] two years later, who seemed to hire whomever wished to help them with their research.

Fate quickly became accustomed, and was even the first to be able to artificially synthesise simple anomalies leading a small team of his two closest friends, one of them being [[164xx]], who grew interest in his project, giving him the funding he needed to accomplish most goals, the other being [[Ariah Marlyn Grey]], who's research into the extraction of DNA from anomalies made it possible to synthesize them in the first place, seeing that their cellular structure is quite different to the ones found in most animals.

This scientific breakthrough allowed them to quickly climb to the top of the ranks within [[Church of Dog]], creating bioweapons and biological entities supporting agriculture, construction and other branches.

After becoming a member of the [[Science Council]], Fate focussed his attention to integrating modern technologies with the biological body. Creating the first fully functioning prosthetic body parts, like: legs, arms and even organs with a team of scientists.

Fate's focus then switched to a greater goal after most of the member of [[Council of Dog]] got murdered, and they switched focus to [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], which Fate successfully completed after a couple years with his team.

After [[PROJECT-INFUSION]] was completed, and the definition of a perfect humanoid was made, Fate noticed the failure on their own flesh, and got hooked on improving the human genome. After being refused a test subject by the [[Council of Dog]], Fate took it upon himself and experimented upon their own genome. Causing Fate to get quite sick for a year until they made their own bionic arm that extended into some of his internal organs. Acting as a form of life-support, while also allowing Fate to change their own genome on a whim. Giving him shape-shifting like abilities.

Currently actively working on [[THREAT]] with a small team of two other scientists in [[LAB-03]].

## Trivia:
- Bioengineered a creature for Halloween and let it loose in LAB-01. The entity was harmless, and died after five hours (due to not having a mouth to eat), but scared quite a few interns who thought it was an escaped entity.
