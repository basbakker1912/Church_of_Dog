## Formal Data:
Name: Fate "\[CLASSIFIED]" Sebastian
Age: See Backstory

Member of: [[Church of Dog]]
Position: [[Science Council]] Member and Project Lead
Rank: #CDL5 

Primary Project: [[THREAT]]
Secondary Projects: [[PROJECT-INFUSION]]

## Characteristics:
Fate is mostly quiet individual. Preferring to spend time diving into their research over communicating, although given the chance, will ramble for hours over his current and past research projects.

Non-Binary

## Backstory:
Born eighteen years before the takeover of [[Malphoros]], and has been fascinated by the biological beings that inhabit the world. Spending most of his time catching small reptiles and amphibious animals and keeping them in his room.

What interested him more, however, was the minds of those around them. The working of their minds and the manipulation of their thoughts through the machinery. He got caught by his mother dissecting a frog at the age of fourteen while it was still alive.

He continued experimenting with biological mutations and adaptations for a while after. Experiments often ending in failures, using the machinery he could afford by selling the AI's he trained on his computer as a hobby, finding actual real-world applications for some companies.

The world got taken by storm before he could start his Scholarship in Biochemistry, seeing as the world got taken by storm by [[Malphoros]] killing [[Seraphos]]. This takeover, however, gave up a multitude of new chances. As the [[Anomalies]] made by [[Malphoros]] gave him a formidable job in the [[Country of YES]] two years later, who seemed to hire whomever wished to help them with their research.

He quickly became accustomed, and was even the first to be able to artificially synthesise a simple anomalies leading a small team of his two closest friends, one of them being [[164xx]], who grew interest in his project, giving him the funding he needed to accomplish his goals, the other being [[Ariah Marlyn Grey]], who's research into the extraction of the anomalies DNA made it possible to synthesize the anomalies in the first place, seeing that their cellular structure is quite different to the ones found in most animals.

This scientific breakthrough allowed them to quickly climb to the top of the ranks within [[Church of Dog]], creating bioweapons and biological entities supporting agriculture, construction and other branches.

After becoming a member of the [[Science Council]], he focussed his attention to integrating modern technologies with the biological body. Creating the first fully functioning prosthetic body parts, like: legs, arms and even organs with a team of scientists.

His focus then switched to a greater goal after most of the member of [[Council of Dog]] got murdered, and he switched his focus to [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], which he successfully completed after a couple years.

After [[PROJECT-INFUSION]] was completed, he wanted to shift his focus on improving the human genome. After being refused a test subject by the [[Council of Dog]], he took it upon himself and experimented upon his own genome. Causing him to get quite sick for a year until he made his own bionic arm that extended into some of his internal organs. Acting as a form of life-support, while also allowing him to change him own genome on a whim. Giving him shape-shifting like abilities.

Currently actively working on [[THREAT]] with a small team of two other scientists in [[LAB-03]].
