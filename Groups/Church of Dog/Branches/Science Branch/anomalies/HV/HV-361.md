# Description
[[HV-361]] is a wooden, almost puppet like lower arm and hand. Inlaid with seemingly four green emeralds of composition incomparable to emeralds within our possession. 

The arm is permanently bound to a person upon contact, and there is currently no way to sever this connection, although the death of the wielder is speculated to do this. Severing the arm from the wielder seems to be ineffective to, as the arms can only be reattached to said wielder.

The arm, once in contact with a surface, allows the wielder to to grow any form of plant-based organism attached to said surface. There seems to be no known limitation to what the wielder can make the item grow.
The following has been observed:
- Trees
- Vines
- Grass
- Moss
- Herbs with extremely targeted medical effects

The growth seems to take time however, and a path of vegetation needs to be made from the wielders position to it's target.
