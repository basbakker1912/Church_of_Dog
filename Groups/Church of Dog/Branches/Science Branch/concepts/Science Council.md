Unlike [[Black Dogs]], having a distinct leader, the [[Science Branch]] is made out of a council of five members.

Each member of the council is at almost all times leading a project of their own, except for one:[[Ariah Marlyn Grey]], who primarily does the monitoring and administrative work of the council.

Current Members:
- [[Ariah Marlyn Grey]]
- [[Fate]]
