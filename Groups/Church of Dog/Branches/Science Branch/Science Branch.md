Researcher 1912: Fate "Mash" \[REDACTED]

What can I say. Hell, there's nothing to say even.

It's been a year since that walking god complex has taken over, and unlike his predecessor, he has no clue when it comes to creating anything but the eldritch horrors and entities he produces.

Like, there nothing more that he does these days. I wouldn't say he's improving as of now, but only the future will tell if it stays that way. If he makes anything more fucked up than we've seen so far we might have to make another LAB, this low budged piece of shit won't hold anything larger than a bear.

But hey, at least having to force a bunch of idiots that have only worked in rural design to take a masterclass in containment (*I'm talking to you [[Connor]]*) is going to fill my day to day life with something other than the daily CQB trainings [[164xx]] is making me go through. Yes, I know I'm shit at them but come on, combat just ain't my field, alright!

Anyhow, quite curious where this projects going to go, blah blah, blah. If it wasn't for the [[Council of Dog]] forcing me to record these messages I would've never hit the record button to begin with. Should never had designed that translation device.

Back to work we go... \*click\*
