## Backstory\
Born as a result from an experiment gone right. He was the first [[Demi-Dogs]] in existence. Due to his experimental nature, he has a direct mental connection with the dead [[Seraphos]], who is currently as a second Soul in his mind. 

Being 'born' at the young age of eighteen, he immediately (and technically forcefully) joined the [[Black Dogs]], and quickly became a well established member of the team.

From the first day Shiba tried to learn how to be 'human', his lack of emotions made him very curious why and how normal ppl operate in comparison to him. Most interesting he always found death and how ppl react to it studding it closely and making sure he can observer it from as closely as possible. Before he learn how properly communicate, he use to jump scare personnel by out of nowhere, some time when they thought they are alone, asking very precise and/or personal question orientated around death, his not friendly appearance did not help him.

Under [[164xx]]'s command, he helped the team accomplish many tasks ranging from assault on foreign countries, gaining is respect, to free them from the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]]'s grasp, or sometimes even peaceful expeditions to spread the love for [[Ice Cream]] and [[Dogs]]. 

He forged his own weapon: A revolver nicknamed "Judgment" chambered in 500 S&W Magnum, a better name would be executioner as he only uses it as a (how he says it) finishing move to execute an enemy. He is extremely protective over it, not allowing no one to handle it. Once during combat a scavenger manage to snatch it and Shiba run in pursuit. Week later in local news there was an article about bodies so mauled, without dna testing no one could tell these where remaining of 5 ppl.

In 17 ACY, he took command of the [[Black Dogs]] from [[164xx]], due to [[Operation-False Prophet]] aftermath and turned the [[Black Dogs]] into a partial PMC to fund the [[Church of Dog]]s expansion into the mainland.

These days every one would say he is colder than when he was 'Born', due to the fact he want every one to be on there best behavior, every one close to him would tell you under his stone cold heart is a man ready to die for his brothers. Unless you ask [[Rose]], due to theirs never ending 'conflict' they will never say anything positive about each other, Shiba claims it all started when she run into him and refuse to say sorry till this day. Yet Shiba don't trust no once else if he needs a medical attention.
## ROLE: 
- Leader
- Point man, death dose not scare him rather amuse, sometimes this carelessness will lead into unnecessary dangerous circumstances 

## NOTES/TRIVIA:
- Is the first of the [[Demi-Dogs]]
- Due to the [[Demi-Dogs]] extra strength, as a joke side project, he made a fridge-sword (as he calls it).
  Impractical weapon/tool that can serve as a fictional fridge and/or Scottish Claymore [[Fridgemore-v1.png]]. He never took it too combat but continues to tease his team that he will one day.
- Food nerd, can smell poison on whatever the food is.
- Due to being the first result of [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], and the experiment going differently than expected. His Soul is in direct connection to the [[Seraphos]], who can talk to him, listen to his ears and see through his eyes, due to that occasionally he will be hit with a visions, no connection to real events has been found yet, side effect of these visions range from confusion is a sound/visual real of a mirage to a full out lock-in syndrome, these effect can last up to 6h. Next to this, [[Shiba]] can use the [[Seraphos]]'s remaining power for his own doings.
- Is the only [[Demi-Dogs]] that knows the recipe to ice cream, being directly told by the [[Seraphos]].
- Accidentally ordered an air strike onto his team [[AAR-Radioban]]
