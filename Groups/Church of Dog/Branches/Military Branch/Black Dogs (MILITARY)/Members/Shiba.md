## Backstory\
Born as a result from an experiment gone right. He was the first [[Demi-Dogs]] in existence. Due to his experimental nature, he has a direct mental connection with the dead [[Seraphos]], who is currently as a second Soul in his mind. 

Being 'born' with looks of a peron at the young age of eighteen, he immediately (and technically forcefully) joined the [[Black Dogs]], and quickly became a well established member of the team.

Under [[164xx]]'s command, he helped the team accomplish many tasks ranging from assault on foreign countries, to free them from the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]]'s grasp, or sometimes even peaceful expeditions to spread the love for [[Ice Cream]] and [[Dogs]].

He forged his own weapon: A massive fridge. Capable of transforming into an extremely large bastard sword for both carrying and combat. This was the masterpiece of his massively, and rapidly expanding arsenal of weaponry, and he always caries the weapon on his back.

In 17 ACY, he took command of the [[Black Dogs]] from [[164xx]], due to [[Operation-False Prophet]] aftermath and turned the [[Black Dogs]] into a partial PMC to fund the [[Church of Dog]]s expansion into the mainland.

- Due to the [[Demi-Dogs]] extra strength, as a joke side project, he made a fridge-sword (as he calls it).

- Due to being the first result of [[PROJECT-INFUSION]], and the experiment going differently than expected. His Soul is in direct connection to the [[Seraphos]], who can talk to him, listen to his ears and see through his eyes, due to that occasionally he will be hit with a visions, no connection to real events has been found yet, side effect of these visions range from confusion is a sound/visual real of a mirage to a full out lock-in syndrome, these effect can last up to 6h. Next to this, [[Shiba]] can use the [[Seraphos]]'s remaining power for his own doings.
