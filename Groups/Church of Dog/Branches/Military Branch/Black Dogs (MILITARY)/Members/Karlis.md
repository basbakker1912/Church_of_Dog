# BACKSTORY
NOTES:
- Basic NPC

TODO:
He was originally created in [[LAB-03]] as a result of the attempted reconstruction of a human body (prototype for [[PROJECT-INFUSION]]), and was split off after it has done it's purpose. The machine however to do this process, was kept around. And morphed into another project.

Said project, developed separately but under guidance of [[Mash]], was made in an attempt to make a sort of "Immortal soldier" by allowing a mind to jump to a new body upon death.

The project failed however, seeing that existing minds could not be transferred into the project, but a synthetically saved one could however.

The project works by, upon death by an individual, transferring their consciousness (memories, personality, etc) into a new body.

Due to it's expensive construction cost and low applicability (seeing that death was not as much of an issue as expected), it was never redeployed. The original device, however, was kept around. And the person who resides in it was kept around and later became a member of [[Black Dogs]].

Moral dillema for RP would be: If you transfer the mind, do you transfer the Soul?
