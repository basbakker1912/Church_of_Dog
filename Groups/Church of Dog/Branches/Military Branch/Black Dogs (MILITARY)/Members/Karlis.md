## Backstory:
He was originally created in [[LAB-03]] as a result of the attempted reconstruction of a human body (prototype for [[Project Infusion]]), and was split off after it has done it's purpose. The machine however to do this process, was kept around. And morphed into another project.

Said project, developed separately but under guidance of [[Fate]], was made in an attempt to make a sort of "Immortal soldier" by allowing a mind to jump to a new body upon death.

The project failed however, seeing that existing minds could not be transferred into the project, but a synthetically saved one could however.

The project works by, upon death by an individual, transferring their consciousness (memories, personality, etc) into a new body.

Due to it's expensive construction cost and low applicability (seeing that death was not as much of an issue as expected), it was never redeployed. The original device, however, was kept around. And the person who resides in it was kept around and later became a member of [[Black Dogs]].

A save of the mind gets made every hour, as long as their is a wireless connection to the outside. Causing a rollback if a save is not capable of being made on death.

A downside of this system however, is that the body never truly feels like it belongs to the mind inhabiting it. Causing effects like existential dread and body dysmorphia.

The prototype is also unfortunately quite unstable, and causes the body of the user to be practically entirely different every single time. Although most key features, like; gender, age and physique, etc. Smaller features, like; hair color, eye color, minor skin tone differences and sizes of body parts can differ from time to time.

  The bodies were not recognisable afterwards, so we did not know which corpse belong to who. 
- Constantly fights with [[Shiba]] because of his God Complex.
- Has a transporter build into his chamber to bring him back after his death.
