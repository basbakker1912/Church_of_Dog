Physical Appearance: See Characteristics

Member of: [[Church of Dog]]
Position: Operative Member of Black Dogs and Markswoman
Rank: #CDL3
## Characteristics:
Violet Undertaker is a slightly tall female, standing at approximately 1,80 cm. Adorned by short, black hair and an athletic build, her arms were blown away, so they have been replaced by state of the art bio-mechanical arms that help her in stabilising her aim. Violet’s left eye has been blinded from an injury during one of her missions, leaving the iris in a grey colour, with her pupil fractured, spilling out like a black river into the grey colour of her iris. Her right eye however has stayed normal, with its purple colour.
Violet prefers personal time and silence more than anything, but won’t say no to small talk or conversation. Despite her rough appearance, Violet is a fairly friendly personality to be around, however whenever her switch flips, it’s usually a bad sign for those around her.

## Backstory:
Violet Undertaker was born on 9 BCY, growing up as any normal child Violet enjoyed her ordinary life. That was until the Good God died, making her country mobilise a nation-wide recruitment order to field an army capable of defending whatever threats might be posed by the Bad God. This led to Violet’s inevitable enlistment and training in the army. At 8 ACY, Violet would be faced with her first covert mission inside the Country of YES after years of simple training and simulations, she came to show her aptitude for long range combat and incredible aim. However her cover was blown, as she was forced to fight hand-to-hand and lose, only to be marginally saved by her squadmate nearby. After the mission ended and her squad returned safely back to base, Violet would come to train her aim to become near-perfect, making her a valuable asset to her country’s army. Violet accomplished many missions alongside different squadmates, however difficult they might’ve been to work with. 

At 13 ACY, Violet was sent on an undercover mission in an unknown country. During that mission she would come to be ambushed and, in the middle of the fighting, lose her left eye from a knife coated with an unknown chemical. Upon returning to her country, she was falsely accused of treason and exiled to the country of YES. There, she sought out a place to work, and was later recruited by the Church of Dog as an operative for the Black Dogs. There, a member of the Black Dogs Science Council took an interest in Violet’s eye injury, offering to provide a suppressant, so as the infection wouldn’t turn Violet into something irreversible. Thanks to the suppressants, Violet was able to return to action in nearly the same state as before her injury. 
However misfortune wouldn’t flee from her as she could come to face another serious injury, at 18 ACY, Violet would be met with an assassination attempt from her previous country, leading to them rigging her car to explode. This unfortunate event led to Violet losing both her arms in the explosion. Before the blood loss could kill her, the Church of Dog managed to save her. Thankfully, her luck wouldn’t run out just yet, as the same person who reached out to provide her with a suppressant, would also be kind enough to ensure the continued function of her arms, through biomechanical engineering. After some months of recovery and easing into her new arms, Violet would ask for a rifle once again, proving to the Black Dogs that no matter how much she was beat up, she was still confident and capable enough to fight for them.

## Special Items:
- A silver ring given to Violet by her mother before she was exiled
- A portrait photo from Violet’s military graduation, 
- A coloured contact lens for her right eye in order to portray it as a more normal colour.
## Trivia:
- Violet usually draws random stuff at the spots where she stations herself for recon and suppressive fire. They’re not Picasso's Mona Lisa, but they leave Violet happy with how they look.
- Once, Violet attempted to use her biomechanical arms as a phone charger, but quickly figured out that despite their mechanical capabilities, they didn’t possess such a feature.
