Full operation log [[AAR-False Prophet]]

[[Operation-False Prophet]] was not only a huge failure on the side of [[Mastiff logistics]], due to them never having dealt, nor having been trained in such a scenario. But was also heavily to blame on [[Doberman Intelligence Agency]]. The operation almost resulting in a complete wipe-out of the [[Black Dogs]] unit.

After the interrogation of: \[CLASSIFIED], [[Doberman Intelligence Agency]] reported an enemy region leader, name: \[REDACTED] being in a specific area. His elimination, and the consequences that would follow, would help the [[Church of Dog]] regain control of said area within: [[East Prophitia]]. Pinpointing their location became of high value to the agency.

[[Gregory Wilhelm]], who was currently a nominee for the [[Doberman Intelligence Agency]] council seat, which recently came available after one of the members succumbed to an assassination. Wished to cease the opportunity for himself. In his attempts to take all the fame, he broke a multitude of security protocols and even started threatening other personnel with a firearm to stop them from hunting down the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] leader themselves.

Within a week, he pushed a report to the [[Doberman Intelligence Agency Council]]. The speed at which this report was made, among with the ambiguity of the facts states within, it should have been flagged and thrown away. But, due to the fact that the [[Black Dogs]] unit was already within the area, a shot was made regardless.

As it turned out, this area did not contain the location of said [[The Rat Association (TRA)|TRA]] leader, instead, the [[Black Dogs]] stumbled upon an enemy convoy. Unprepared for a fight, they were outmatched and contact was lost. This caused [[Mastiff logistics]] to have to scramble together a QRF force together to get said personnel out

Operation False Prophet was a huge failure not only from the [[Mastiff logistics]] side as they never dealt with similar scenario but mainly [[Intelligence agency]] that almost costed us entire [[Black Dogs]] unit.
After interrogating (CLASIFIED) [[Intelligence agency]] reported about enemy regional leader [REDACTED] being in the area, end eliminating him would massively improve control over the region, and would earn a lot of praises to whom help locate him as we never got close to locating him let alone pin pointing his location.
[[Gregory Wilhelm]] , member of interrogation team and a nominee for [[Intelligence agency]] leader could not passed the opportunity for his own gain, he broke multiple protocols and threaten other members with a sidearm to keep quiet. He pushed a report about [REDACTED] to hi-com, it should have raised red flags how fast it was made and vague in some parts the report was but due to the fact [[Black Dogs]] where in the area we did not wanted to miss a shot at him.
By the time we realise what happend it was to late, contact with [[Black Dogs]] unit was last due to a ambush planted and coordinated by [[The Rat Association (TRA)]]. In a full chaos [[Mastiff logistics]] had to scramble QRF, Coms, live feed and more to rescue [[Black Dogs]]
