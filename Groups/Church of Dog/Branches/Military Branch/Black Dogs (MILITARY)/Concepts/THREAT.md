THREAT is an AI powered system, capable of using satellites, drones and other machinery as a surveillance network.

Designed from the ground up to bring direct combat feedback on the active situation on nearby combatives, it applies a complex system of predictions to accurately portray what the enemies next move may be.

Designed by [[Fate]], who was also the head developer and project lead of [[Project "Infusion"]].

What is not publicly known, not even to most of the members of [[Black Dogs]] (with a few exceptions of the highest of the highest), is that [[THREAT]] is not just an AI running on a computer. Instead, it's a highly adaptive, self-replicating biomechanical monstrosity that uses the most advanced forms of mathematical predictions with the creativity and uniqueness of the animalistic brain for optimal results.

It's chamber and housing, contained on the deepest level of [[LAB-03]], and is under constant supervision since "INCIDENT 02"
