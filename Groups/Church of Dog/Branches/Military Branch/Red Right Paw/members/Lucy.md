## Backstory
Born in 8 ACY out of the collapse of a cross-dimensional rift in 8 ACY during [[Project "Infusion"]]. After a group of science personnel calmed her down, she was taken in under the wing of [[Fate]], who used the downtime during the massive amount of waiting [[Project "Infusion"]] required to nurture her into this world.

Her origins are unknown, she doesn't even know herself. The most likely proposition is that she was synthetically made during one of the rift implosions, which would explain her vastly different cellular anatomy.

She seemed to not have been able to speak any language at the time, her muscles were also heavily underdeveloped and her body seemed malnourished. Although the working of her cells are very different to ours, she seems to still be able to obtain nourishment from the same foods as other humans and has a need to consume water, although she requires a lot less than a human body.
