\[CLASSIFIED]

[[Kite]]'s upbringing was unknown, he was part of one of the refuge centres after [[The Seraphos Extermination]].

He was taken in to separate care after an unknown object was found upon him (later designated [[HV-361]]). It was initially missed due to the massive amounts of refugees fleeing to the [[Country of YES]].

Although [[Kite]] claimed to have had the arm for a long time, his experience with it was quite low, seeing that he was unable to do anything with it other than moving it around like one'd suspect a normal arm to do.

Over a period of time, he seemed to gain quite the skills with it, given the fact that the [[Church of Dog]] gave him all the time and space to do so.

He esteemed to use his newfound power for good, and decided to join the [[Military Branch]] at the age of 15 as a medic. Using his capability to create herbs to his liking as medicine.

He fought bravely, and helped many. During this time-period he spent a lot of effort.
