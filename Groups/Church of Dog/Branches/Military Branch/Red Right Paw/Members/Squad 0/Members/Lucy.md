### Backstory

Suddenly appearing in 8 ACY out of the collapse of a cross-dimensional rift in 8 ACY during [[Project Infusion]]. Panicking heavily due to her sudden new scenery, or better yet, lack of the known old one. Combine this with the fact that nobody was understandable and everything was extremely bright. She knocked herself out by stumbling over one of the many cables and hitting her head into the glass of the Replicator chamber.

She woke up a day later in a hospital bed; with a bandage on her head and on a set of painkillers.
After about two hours of shoving herself into the corner of her bed, scuddling away from the beeping machines and growling at every nurse attempting to calm her nerves. She opened up quite a lot more after a kind researcher ([[Fate]]) offered her a chocolate chip cookie, which she, initially hesitantly, and eventually very eagerly gobbled up.

Seeing the fact that she broke the glass of their only Replicator Unit for [[Project Infusion]], said researcher visited her for a couple hours a day; taking the time to teach her the basics of the spoken language among other things. They became quite close during this period of time, often playing video games as well.

When she was released from the hospital, she was given the old room of [[Kira]], who was unbeknownst to her, missing for two years now. [[Fate]] rejected at least a dozen request by a multitude of high-ranking [[Science Branch]] members to perform research on [[Lucy]]. (This was before the [[Synthetic Rights Agreement]], resulting in her having no rights at the time, nor was she in a state to understand what was meant with the "research" planned on her.)

Although [[Fate]] was often more busy with their research on [[Project Infusion]], they still made effort to teach [[Lucy]] a good amount of knowledge in their free time. [[Lucy]] even called [[Fate]] "Dad" from time to time, which brought them delight.

After about a year, she got quite proficient in fitting in with the modern lifestyle and showed great interest in acrobatics and combat related tasks. Often practicing with makeshift puppets of hostiles. [[Fate]], having a three month break at the time due to the long construction period of the new Replicator Unit, decided to dedicate some time into developing an exoskeleton for [[Lucy]]. She gave a lot of feedback during the development process, the end result being a slim, flexible but still strong piece of machinery that enhances her capabilities without being limiting in other sections.

She joined the recruitment program for the [[Red Right Paw]] in 11 ACY, and succeeded with flying colours.
