# Backstory
[[Ethan]] was brought upon this world, being the result of another successful test of [[Project Infusion]] in 15 ACY. The [[Science Branch]], having learned their lessons, gave him the correct tutoring and schooling he needed to become a normal functioning human, and allowed him to join the military in 16 ACY.

In his fireteam, he met [[Kite]], who he became quite the team with. Covering each others weaknesses and having the time of their lives. [[Kite]] eventually left for the [[Red Right Paw]], which he dragged [[Ethan]] into a month later, whether he liked it or not.

He was originally part of [[Squad 3]], where he fought bravely, although a bit stubbornly dangerous at time. [[Kite]] was always there to patch him up in a pinch, though. He eventually joined [[Squad 7]] after being invited into it by [[Lucy]].

He's been in active duty ever since.

(Bit short, but he only lived for 6 years so far)
