Female, 182 cm's in height. She has beige hair reaching to her shoulders, of which she has painted the tips pink. She often wears her hair in a ponytail of sorts. Her eyes are a pink hue.

She has a sleeve tattoo of roses all over her right arm. Looking like [[Lucy-Tattoo.jpg]], but the roses are the same color as her eyes instead.

She wears the standard set of shirt and pants provided to all [[Red Right Paw]] operatives of her rank, but rolls up her right sleeve to just above her elbow to show off the sleave. Next to this, she wears a sturdy set of boots.

Personality wise, she takes her job quite serious, but misses no opportunity to do so in style. She even has a set of sunglasses on her at all time to play the act. 
### Backstory

Suddenly appearing in 8 ACY out of the collapse of a cross-dimensional rift in 8 ACY during [[Project Infusion]]. Panicking heavily due to her sudden new scenery, or better yet, lack of the known old one. Combine this with the fact that nobody was understandable and everything was extremely bright. She knocked herself out by stumbling over one of the many cables and hitting her head into the glass of the Replicator chamber.

She woke up a day later in a hospital bed; with a bandage on her head and on a set of painkillers.
After about two hours of shoving herself into the corner of her bed, scuddling away from the beeping machines and growling at every nurse attempting to calm her nerves. She opened up quite a lot more after a kind researcher ([[Fate]]) offered her a chocolate chip cookie, which she, initially hesitantly, and eventually very eagerly gobbled up.

Seeing the fact that she broke the glass of their only Replicator Unit for [[Project Infusion]], said researcher visited her for a couple hours a day; taking the time to teach her the basics of the spoken language among other things. They became quite close during this period of time, often playing video games as well.

When she was released from the hospital, she was given the old room of [[Kira]], who was unbeknown to her, missing for two years now. [[Fate]] rejected at least a dozen request by a multitude of high-ranking [[Science Branch]] members to perform research on [[Lucy]]. (This was before the [[Synthetic Rights Agreement]], resulting in her having no rights at the time, nor was she in a state to understand what was meant with the "research" planned on her.)

Although [[Fate]] was often more busy with their research on [[Project Infusion]], they still made effort to teach [[Lucy]] a good amount of knowledge in their free time. [[Lucy]] even called [[Fate]] "Dad" from time to time, which brought them delight.

After about a year, she got quite proficient in fitting in with the modern lifestyle and showed great interest in acrobatics and combat related tasks. Often practicing with makeshift puppets of hostiles. [[Fate]], having a three month break at the time due to the long construction period of the new Replicator Unit, decided to dedicate some time into developing an exoskeleton for [[Lucy]]. She gave a lot of feedback during the development process, the end result being a slim, flexible but still strong piece of machinery that enhances her capabilities without being limiting in other sections.

She joined the recruitment program for the [[Red Right Paw]] in 11 ACY, and succeeded with flying colours. She then joined [[Squad 3]], where she performed tasks for the [[Council of Dog]].

In 13 ACY, she was part of [[Operation Shutdown]], managing to get as many civilians out as possible. She helped [[Kira]] get out of the building, but failed to realise what was going on when [[Fate]] bursted out in tears, but [[Kira]] just looked at them in confusion. She later was told what was going on when they came back home, [[Kira]] being given a new room, [[Lucy]] being allowed to keep her old one.

She eventually took a break from active duty in 14 ACY, preferring to look after her new sister, who still had trouble with some basic tasks due to a combination of PTSD and her memory loss. The fact that [[Fate]] was to busy with stopping themselves from dying, meant she had to take over.

She eventually moved out in 16 ACY, finding her own apartment in the [[Country of YES]], although still near [[Fate]]'s home in case something came up. [[Fate]]'s health had significantly improved since a year prior, and the short distance was more of a preference by [[Lucy]]. She also returned to active duty in the [[Red Right Paw]] as part of [[Squad 3]].

In 17 ACY, she met [[Kite]] at a bar. After a successful night, they ended up dating. Eventually getting [[Kite]] into the [[Red Right Paw]] after a bunch of recommending and bickering to her higher-ups in 18 ACY. She later convinced the same higher-ups to let [[Ethan]], a friend of [[Kite]], into said force as well. This required less effort due to the fact that [[Ethan]] was a [[Demi-Dog]].

During a night of drinking with her friends in 19 ACY, she got drunk, and started exaggerating about: "How'd she create her own team" and "How she'd do so much better as a lead."
Instead of keeping it there, she followed through, getting permission to create her own squad with her four friends, resulting in the creation of [[Squad 7]].

She's been in active duty since.
