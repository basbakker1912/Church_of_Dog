## Characteristics:
Species: [[Corvice]]

Female, 176 cm's in height. Her skin is darker in tone and she has brown hair and black irises. Her wings are brown with white feathers. Her tail is also brown with a white tip. The fur on her legs is brown.

She has pierced her right ear; both the top and earlobe with silver piercings.

Her clothing consists of: A turtleneck leotard, combined with a long-sleeved combat shirt on top. She refuses to wear anything not covering her arms and neck, as she does not wish to show her scars.

She doesn't wear pants, due to finding the fabric irritating in contact with the skin. The bone structure of said legs not allowing for an easy fitting as well. Same goes for boots.

Personality wise, she's a mischievous and silly little goober. Often pulling pranks on her friends or making jokes. Next to this, she often plays around with her enemies when she's in an advantage, which may lead to her losing said advantage.
## Backstory
[[Avery]] was originally artificially made on 14 ACY along 3 other [[Corvice]], their names unknown.
Directly thrown into the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] to serve, not knowing any better, she did so. Being part of a multitude of raids on various different [[Catnip Corporation]] and [[Church of Dog]] assets.

Being brainwashed into believing that what they were doing was right, she followed practically every order given to her. Failure often ended with beatings, or worse. So she has a multitude of scars from either the punishments themselves, or the medical stitching following up. Until in 15 ACY, during a small sneak around the facility with a key card she and her sister (\[REDACTED]) stole from a [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] member. She stumbled onto a room, shoving the effects their actions had on the world.

Being disgusted by this outcome, combined by the already strong will to get out, she and her sister suddenly fled during a field mission two weeks later. Laying low in a bunch of villages and towns on [[East Prophitia]], although failing to find an actual place of stay seeing that their physiques made them quite an easy pick on [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] search parties.

During this period of being on the run, she also picked her name. To the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] she was never anything but an assets, only being referenced to as: "HV-27-2".

They were eventually found, but not by [[The Rat Association (TRA)]]. Instead, a [[Church of Dog]] search party found them during a social alliance mission on [[East Prophitia]]. After coming to the conclusion that [[Avery]] and her sister were not a threat, they were detained and taken in.

After a bunch of questioning and lengthy procedures, they were allowed to stay within the [[Country of YES]] fugitive centres until they got their citizenship. 

During their time there, they were often outcast due to their strange physique and non-conforming behaviour. In 12 ACY, [[Avery]] stumbled upon [[Lucy]], who was spending some of her free time doing work in the fugitive centres. They became quite good friends during this period.

From 14 ACY to 15 ACY, she often helped [[Lucy]] care for [[Kira]], and accompanied during the absence of [[Lucy]]'s parent, who was too busy with his own health. Even though she had not yet obtained her citizenship, she was allowed to leave the refugee centre under guidance by [[Lucy]].

She went through and eventually got her citizenship along with her sister. Her sister was done with the fighting of it all, and decided to get herself into the medical sector. [[Avery]], however, decided to stay within the combat area of it all, finding her purpose there, and recruiting into the same [[Red Right Paw]] her friend [[Lucy]] was in.

Initially, she was rejected. Her combative abilities and skills were up to the norm, but seeing her past, she was rejected. [[Lucy]] however, after pulling a lot of strings, eventually got her accepted anyhow on 17 ACY.

She climbed through the ranks within the next couple years, until in 19 ACY, when she got an invite handed to her by [[Lucy]] for the [[Squad 7]] she was forming, accepting it without much thought.

She is now in active duty.
