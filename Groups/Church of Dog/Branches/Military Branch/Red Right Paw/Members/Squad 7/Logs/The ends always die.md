Flick, there goes a knife.

Bang, there goes a bullet.

One by one, they fall. It's what the human body is so good at, death. One wrong step, one wrong move, and it just, gives up. It might grasp for air, maybe struggle a bit, squirm and wriggle, but at the end of the day, it always ends up being just that, a corpse.

She flicks the blade within her right hand up, gracefully parrying the knife directed at her throat. She continues her momentum into a spin before flicking the barrel of her revolver straight into the jaw of her opponent.

Click, bang, blood, smoke.

That's two.

She switches her attention to the other grunt that decided to stumble in her. Although it was more her tripping while trying to sneak around, this would work to.

It's in the middle of a swing. She could do the lame old parry trick again, but maybe she'd toy with her food this time.

She fakes her swing, dropping her blade right before the metal collides. The two pieces of metal hitting each other with a clang. Her opponent not expecting the sudden absence of force, starts tumbling forward. She spins around and kicks it forward, making it fall face first into the concrete floor.

The grunt spins around quicker than she expects, and swings at her again. Her blade currently being out of her range, she grabs onto the machete with her bare hands.

It cuts straight into her palms, but stops once it hits bone. It hurts, of course it does, but she's not showing it. Just giving that familiar, practiced smile. Black blood starts dripping down her palms onto the floor.

She can practically smell the fear coming of the walking corpse in front of her. Despite the pain, she rips the machete out of the hand of the grunt, it's grip loose enough to do so. The surprise on the grunts face as she flicks the machete up in the air, catching the handle in her palms before throwing the bladed weapon straight into the head of her adversary.

The three threats now dealt with, she takes a moment to recoup herself. Her right hand tingles, the cuts only being slight scarring tissue now. Benefits of being the child of a god, she guesses.
