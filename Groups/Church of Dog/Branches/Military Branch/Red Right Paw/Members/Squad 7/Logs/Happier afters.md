"So, what are we going to do next time, HV-027-3?"

Another lash from that damned, barbed whip hit her back, wrapping all the way around to the front of her waist. It was horrible; kneeling, fully bare to the world, every spec of blood not even red visible to those watching. 

There was nobody watching though. It was just her, a whip, a single light and a closed room, held together by a man only wishing her pain.

Another lash, this time wrapping around her neck, the barbed rope twisting all the way around. A foot was placed on her back, the rope set tighter.

"Please", was all she could get out. Clawing at the source that was ripping the oxygen from her lungs, to no avail. 

"I can't hear you, HV-027-3" The man said in a malicious, playful tone. It was like he's toying with her, they always are.

The world started going black, the only dim light in the room only getting dimmer.

*"Avery"*

The world started to spin, faster and faster. The pain burrowing deeper and deeper into her skin. Tears started sprawling from her eyes, black blood dripping down her neck.

"Avery"

This was it, she was dying. This is where it ends once and for all, and the only thing she has to do, was accept it. The world's going dark, and that was how it should be.

"Avery!"

Suddenly, the world came back running. This time however, she was not in an underground facility with dim lights and burning ropes. She was not in an empty room, laying bare and helpless to the horrific things others wished to inflict on her.

Nope, she was hanging right there, upside down from a tree. The only thing preventing her from hitting the ground ten meters below was a simple tail. A tail which is currently flailing as violently as the rest of her body, as she's approaching the ground at faster and faster rates.

She tries to open her wings, but it's to late, only managing to slow her descent a little.

Accepting her fate, she hits the floor with a dull thud. One thing grass is good for is absorbing energy, and although a fall like this would probably not cause her that much harm even without the assistance of her wings, it still hurts.

Not having the energy to stand up, she just keeps laying there, face first in the grass. The nightmare that was her heads doing still twisting and turning within. Except nightmares aren't the same as memories.

Suddenly, she feels a pair of hands around her waist, pulling her up and setting her upright. Although just letting gravity do it's thing and falling to the floor seems like a great option right now, she doesn't feel like tasting more mud.

"Avery!" A tall, broad man with brown hair and red eyes says to her. "You can't go scaring us like that." He brushes some of the dirt of her clothes, before putting his right hand on her shoulder.

"You okay?"

On any other day she would have said yes. Most of the time that'd be because she was, indeed, "okay". But today, nope, not today.

"I wish, Ethan, I wish." She said with a droopy tone, pulling his hand of her shoulder and sitting down against the same tree she just fell from. "Why'd you come search for me, anyway?"

"The two lovebirds are hugging it out at the fire." Ethan gestures to the warm, orange over his shoulder. "And if my intuition is correct, that will turn into a make-out session that I do not want to be anywhere near of any second now."

That earned him a small giggle. Avery knew those two well, they've been quite the couple for four years now. It's a fun reminder to how far they've come, from how little they had.

Avery notices Ethan grabbing a small, white box from a pouch, flicking it open and grabbing a joint from it, sticking it in his mouth before offering the box to Avery. "Want one? Kite's special."

She doesn't usually smoke, but if you feel as fucked up as you do now, you tend to do stupid things. So she took one. Ethan puts the box back and fishes a lighter out of the same pouch. Offering the flame to her, lighting the cigarette before he does the same to his own.

She takes a deep breath of the bitter, grey smoke. Kite's blend has almost all the same effects as a normal blunt of weed does, except the fact that it's not so addicting. Kite's tumbled down that path of addiction ages ago, and wishes no one an end like that.

As she breathes the smoke back out of her lungs, her sorrows follow with. It's a temporary high, she knows, but anything's better than that low.

They sit in silence for a while, speaking no words as they let the calming drug wash over their minds, muffling their sorrows.

Ethan takes one lass pull on his joint while standing up. Dropping the burned remains to the forest floor and putting his boot upon it, silencing the trickling remains of the flame.

"So," he asks. "Why were you lying face first in the dirt when I finally found you." He offers his hand to Avery, who empties the last puff of smoke from her lungs before taking it. Putting the joint out in a similar fashion to how Ethan did once she's standing.

"Getting ripped out of a night terror tends to have negative effects on you." She muttered, turning towards the fire and walking towards the orange glow, Ethan following right behind her.

"Your fa-", Ethan asks, only to be met with a hiss from Avery. "Do not call him that.", she practically growls out, before continuing to walk towards the fire, mumbling something below her breath.

"Biological parent" Ethan corrects himself with a cough, before increasing his pace to catch up with Avery. "Tough snare, shouldn't have."

"No you're... You're fine, I just don't want to see the man who put me in such a hellish place as anything close to related." She says in a shushed voice. "But the past is the past, really, I'm fine."

"You sure?" Ethan raises an eyebrow at her. "You don't look okay?"

"I'm fine, really." Avery pauses. "For now, at least."

They reach the fire, Kite sitting on the ground with Lucy vast asleep, head on Kite's lap.

"There you are," kite looks up at the newly returned pair. "I was wondering where you two ran off to. Anything of the matter?"

"Yeah, uhm-" Avery starts, before Ethan cuts her off. "I'll take first guard, y'all look like you need some rest."

Kite seemingly takes the hint. "Alright, can you grab our sleeping mats?" He looks at Avery, Ethan having already left to sit on a nearby boulder. "I do not think I can move in this predicament." He gestures to the person on his lap, clearly not planning to wake up.

"Oh yeah, sure." Avery giggles, before grabbing said mats, including one of her own. She hands over their bags. Grabbing hers and walking closer to the fire, rolling it out and laying on top of it. She was definitely too close to said fire for the "fire safety regulations" that were enforced back at base, but the heat was comforting. 

She lays down, looking up at the twinkling night sky above her, before slowly dowsing back into the slumber she so got ripped from. This time, however, without the onset of creeping terrors.

Because tomorrow, she was killing one of the fuckers who did this to her.

And for tomorrow, she couldn't wait.
