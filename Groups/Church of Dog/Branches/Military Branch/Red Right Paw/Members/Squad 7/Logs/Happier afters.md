"So, what are we going to do next time, HV-027-3?"

Another lash from that damned, barbed whip hit her back, wrapping all the way around to the front of her waste. It was horrible; kneeling, fully bare to the world, every spec of blood not even red visible to those watching. 

There was nobody watching though. It was just her, a whip, a single light and a closed room, held together by a man only wishing her pain.

Another lash, this time around her neck, the barbed rope wrapping all the way around her neck. A foot was placed on her back, the rope set tighter.

"Please", was all she could get out. Clawing at the source of her pain around her neck, to no avail. 

"I can't hear you, HV-027-3" The man said in a malicious, playful tone. It was like he's toying with her, they always are.

The world started going black, the only dim light in the room only getting dimmer.

*"Avery"*

The room started to spin, faster and faster. The pain burning brighter and brighter. Tears started sprawling from her eyes, black blood dripping down her neck.

"Avery"

This was it, she was dying. This is where it ends once and for all, and the only thing she has to do, was except it. The world's going dark, and that was how it should be.

"Avery!"

Suddenly, the world came back. This time however, she was not in some underground facility with dim lights and burning ropes. She was not in an empty room, laying bare and helpless to the pain others wished to inflict on her.

Nope, she was hanging right there, upside down from a tree. The only thing preventing her from hitting the ground ten meters below was a simple tail. A tail which is currently flailing as violently as the rest of her body as she's approaching the ground faster and faster.

She tries to open her wings, but it's to late, only managing to slow her descent a little.

Accepting her fate, she hits the floor with a dull plof. One thing grass is good for is absorbing her fall, and although a fall like this would probably not cause her that much harm even without her speed reduction, it'll still hurt.

Not having the energy to stand up, she just keeps laying there, face first in the grass. The nightmare that was her heads doing still twisting and turning within. Except nightmares aren't the same as memories.

Suddenly, she feels a pair of hands around her waist, pulling her up and setting her upright. Although just letting gravity do it's thing and falling to the floor seems like a great option right now, she doesn't feel like tasting more mud.

"Avery!" A tall, broad man with brown hair and red eyes says to her. "You can't go scaring us like that." He brushes some of the dirt of her clothes, before putting his right hand on her shoulder.

"You okay?"

On any other day she would have said yes. Most of the time that' d be because she was, indeed, "okay". But today, nope, not today.

"I wish, Ethan, I wish." She said with a droopy tone, pulling his hand of her shoulder and sitting down against the same tree she just fell from. "Why'd you come search for me, anyway?"

"The two lovebirds are hugging it out at the fire." Ethan looks over his shoulder in the direction of the warm, orange glow. "And if my intuition is correct, that will turn into a make-out session that I do not want to be anywhere near of any second now."

That earned him a small giggle from Avery. She knew those two well, they've been quite the couple for four years now. It's a fun reminder to how far they've come, from how little they had.

Avery notices Ethan grabbing a small, white box from a pouch, flicking it open and grabbing a white cigarette from it, sticking it in his mouth before offering the box to Avery. "Want one? Kite's special."

She doesn't usually smoke, but if you feel as fucked up as you do now, you tend to do stupid things. So she took one. Ethan puts the box back and fishes a lighter out of the same pouch. Offering the flame to her, lighting the cigarette before he does the same to his own.

She takes a deep breath of the bitter, grey smoke. Kite's blend has almost all the same effects as a normal blunt of weed does, except the fact that it's so addicting. Guess being able to design your own herbs has it's bonuses.

As she breathes the smoke back out of her lungs, her sorrows follow with. It's a temporary high, she knows, but anything's better than that temporary low.
