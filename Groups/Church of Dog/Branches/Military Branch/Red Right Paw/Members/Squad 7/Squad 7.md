[[Squad 7]] is a squad, primarily made up of a group of four close friends.

[[Squad 7]] was requested and created by [[Lucy]], who is currently still leading said squad. It contains:
- A [[Nginx]] ([[Lucy]])
- A [[Corvice]] ([[Avery]])
- A [[Demi-Dog]] ([[Ethan]])
- A [[Human]] equipped with [[HV-361]] ([[Kite]])

Next to reporting to the [[Council of Dog]], they also follow the command of [[Fate]] and the [[Science Council]]. This primarily being the fact that [[Lucy]] is quite loyal to her adoptive parent.
