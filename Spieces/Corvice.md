[[Corvice]] are a species created by [[Malphoros]] to directly support the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] in creating a counter against [[Project Infusion]], which they failed to do themselves.

[[Corvice]] are a humanoid species, with a few extra traits, including:
- Wings, coming in a variety of colours.
- A long, sleek tail.
- Legs shaped like the back legs of cats, transitioning at the top of the thigh to human legs.
- Large canine teeth.
- Claw-like nails.
- They bleed black blood.
- The iris is black, and the pupil is normally to small to be visible. During moments of high stress, or excitement, they may enlarge, filling the center of the eye with a white pupil.

Their ability to fly can be easily compromised by adding extra weight onto their bodies, compromising their means of flight.

The species is a carnivore, and has a restricted diet to meat.

[[Corvice]] were originally intended to directly counter [[Project Infusion]], but after the only four members of the species went rogue, due to the fact that [[Malphoros]] did not take free will into account, and most of the [[Corvice]] fled their designated facilities, due to their own desires conflicting with that of [[The Rat Association (TRA)]].

The four [[Corvice]] in existence are related in blood, due to having the same father ([[Malphoros]]), their mother, however, is different for every sibling. To the contrary, they lack a mother, as they were not regularly conceived.

They are instinctively sadistic to strangers, and often mischievous to those who they know. This is due to their relation with [[Malphoros]] in blood. Their trait was also their downfall, however, seeing that the species will often give up their advantage to toy with their pray.
