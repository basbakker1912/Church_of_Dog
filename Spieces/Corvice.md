[[Corvice]] are a species created by [[Malphoros]] to directly support the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] in creating a counter against [[Project Infusion]], which they failed to do themselves.

[[Corvice]] are a humanoid species, with a few extra traits, including:
- Wings, coming in a variety of colors.
- A long, sleek tail.
- Legs shaped like the back legs of cats.
- Claw-like finger tips.

[[Corvice]] were originally intended to directly counter [[Project Infusion]], but after the only four members of the species went rogue, due to the fact that [[Malphoros]] did not take free wil into account.
