[[Corvice]] are a species created by [[Malphoros]] to directly support the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] in creating a counter against [[Project Infusion]], which they failed to do themselves.

[[Corvice]] are a humanoid species, with a few extra traits, including:
- Wings, coming in a variety of colours.
- A long, sleek tail.
- Legs shaped like the back legs of cats, transitioning at the top of the thigh to human legs.
- Large canine teeth.
- Claw-like nails.

The species is a carnivore, and has a restricted diet to meat.

[[Corvice]] were originally intended to directly counter [[Project Infusion]], but after the only four members of the species went rogue, due to the fact that [[Malphoros]] did not take free will into account, and most of the [[Corvice]] fled their designated facilities, due to their own desires conflicting with that of [[The Rat Association (TRA)]].

The four [[Corvice]] in existence are related in blood, due to having the same father ([[Malphoros]]), their mother, however, is different for every sibling. They however, lack a mother, as they were not regularly conceived.

First sighted in 14 ACY.
