[[Cats]] were made by the [[Bad God]] as a way to keep control over the [[Dogs]], a sort of catalyst, as you may.

[[Cats]] however, didn't want to be controlled by the [[Bad God]], this came after they were in a war with the [[Dogs]] against their own will, and thus, they formed an alliance (ADD LINK) with the [[Dogs]] to break free from his control.

NOTES:
- Cats hate swimming, all of them.
