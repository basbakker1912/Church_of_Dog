## Species
### UNKNOWN

The [[Nginx]] lived way before the first [[Godhood|God]] existed, in a time that contained a lot of strange and anomalous entities and objects. Lucy, back then, fell into an interdimensional rift and got stuck in time during the [[Singularity Collapse]]. This caused her memories to go funky and the rest of her species to be wiped out, or to end up in the same state as she used to be.
### KNOWN

The species anatomy seems to be similar to a human, with some major differences:
- The skin is fully white
- The ears appear more in line with a feline. Unlike the popular media item called: "Catgirls", the ears are not on top of the head, and instead seem to be attached where you would expect normal human ears to be.
- The iris glows, the only known color being purple.
- Large canines.

The species seems to have other traits to:
- Preference to nonverbal communication, although capable of speech.
- Heightened senses in the aspects of: Smell, touch and hearing. These senitivities can work in the species favour, but they also have a relatively low pain tolerance and brittle skin.
- Heightened abilities of perception and intuition. This includes the ability to quickly learn and copy others, often seen in: Learning languages, usage of tools and other skills.
- Improved acrobatic abilities when not unencumbered. 
- Ability to see in the dark.

The species has trouble with mass in our world, however, and seems to need to exert twice the amount of effort to lift the same amount of weight, and thus tiring out far more easily. All (currently one) members of this species are issued special exoskeletons to help with their day to day lives.

Although the species has some cat-like features, they do not represent cats in their behaviour, coming closer to a humanoid with a tint of nonverbal wolf behaviour.

First sighted in 8 ACY as [[Lucy]].
