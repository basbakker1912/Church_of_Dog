## Species
### UNKNOWN

The [[Nginx]] lived way before the first [[Godhood|God]] existed, in a time that contained a lot of strange and anomalous entities and objects. The members of the species that survived this, fell into rifts created during the [[Singularity Collapse]] that are currently being reopened.
### KNOWN

The species anatomy seems to be similar to a human, with some major differences:
- The skin is fully white, but can be toned darker to hide away at will.
- The ears appear more in line with a feline. Unlike the popular media item called: "Catgirls", the ears are not on top of the head, and instead seem to be attached where you would expect normal human ears to be.
- The iris glows.
- Large canines.

The species seems to have other traits to:
- Preference to nonverbal communication, although capable of speech.
- Heightened senses in the aspects of: Smell, touch and hearing. These sensitivities can work in the species favour, but they also have a relatively low pain tolerance and brittle skin.
- Heightened abilities of perception and intuition. This includes the ability to quickly learn and copy others, often seen in: Learning languages, usage of tools and other skills.
- Improved acrobatic abilities when not over encumbered. 
- Ability to see in the dark.

The species has trouble with mass in our world, however, and seems to need to exert twice the amount of effort to lift the same amount of weight, and thus tiring out far more easily. All (currently one) members of this species are issued special exoskeletons to help with their day to day lives.

Although the species has some cat-like features, they do not represent cats in their behaviour, coming closer to a humanoid with a tint of nonverbal wolf behaviour.

First sighted in 8 ACY as [[Lucy]].
