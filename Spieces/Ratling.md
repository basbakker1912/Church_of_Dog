[[Ratling]] are a humanoid species created after [[Malphoros]] failed to gain control upon the [[Corvice]] species.

They lack all forms of free will, and are better described as puppets with a consciousness. Rejecting orders from [[Malphoros]] seems to cause them physical harm, even when they cannot hear said orders.

Rattling's look the most similar to humanoids, with rat-like whiskers on their noses.

First sighted in 20 ACY
